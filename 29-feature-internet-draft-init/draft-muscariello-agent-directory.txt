                        Agent Directory Protocol
                draft-muscariello-agent-directory-latest

Abstract

   This document specifies a protocol for announcing and discovering AI
   agents in a distributed system using the Open Agentic Schema
   Framework (OASF).  The Agent Directory Protocol enables agents to
   advertise their capabilities through attribute-based taxonomies and
   discover other agents based on their skills.  The protocol leverages
   a Distributed Hash Table (DHT) for storing and retrieving agent
   directory records.

1.  Introduction

   As AI systems become more prevalent, there is an increasing need for
   agents to discover and interact with each other dynamically based on
   their capabilities.  The Agent Directory Protocol provides a
   standardized way for agents to:

   *  Announce their presence using OASF attribute taxonomies

   *  Discover other agents based on required skills and attributes

   *  Maintain distributed directory information in a DHT

   *  Enable attribute-based routing and discovery

   The protocol is designed to be fully distributed, extensible, and
   secure while supporting the dynamic nature of agentic AI systems.

2.  Protocol Overview

2.1.  OASF Attributes

   The protocol uses OASF to define attribute taxonomies that describe
   agent capabilities.  These attributes fall into categories such as:

   *  Skills and competencies

   *  Domain knowledge

   *  Interaction patterns

   *  Security propertion Attributes are organized hierarchically and
      can be extended to support new capabilities.

2.2.  DHT-based Directory

   Agent directory records are stored in a DHT with the following
   properties:

   *  Records are indexed by attribute combinations

   *  Support for partial and wildcard attribute matching

   *  Built-in replication and fault tolerance

   *  Decentralized operation with no single point of failure

3.  Conventions and Definitions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

4.  Security Considerations

   The Agent Directory Protocol relies on several security mechanisms to
   ensure the integrity and authenticity of directory records:

4.1.  Record Signatures

   All agent directory records MUST be digitally signed by the producing
   agent.  The signature covers:

   *  The complete set of OASF attributes

   *  The agent's capabilities description

   *  Any additional metadata

   Signatures enable consumers to verify the authenticity and integrity
   of records independent of their location in the DHT.

4.2.  Location Independence

   Agent directory records are location-independent - their trust is
   derived from cryptographic signatures rather than network location.
   This means:

   *  Records can be cached and replicated across the DHT

   *  Consumers can verify records regardless of the serving node

   *  Man-in-the-middle attacks are prevented through signature
      verification

4.3.  Key Management

   Agents MUST generate and maintain cryptographic key pairs following
   these requirements:

   *  Use of asymmetric cryptography (e.g., Ed25519)

   *  Private keys MUST be properly secured by agents

   *  Public keys are distributed as part of agent records

   *  Key rotation procedures MUST be supported

4.4.  DHT Security

   The DHT implementation MUST provide:

   *  Node authentication to prevent Sybil attacks

   *  Secure routing to prevent record tampering

   *  Replication policies to ensure availability

   *  Access controls for record updates

4.5.  Transport Security

   All protocol interactions MUST use secure transport with:

   *  Mutual authentication between nodes

   *  Perfect forward secrecy

   Implementations MUST NOT support plaintext communications.

5.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
