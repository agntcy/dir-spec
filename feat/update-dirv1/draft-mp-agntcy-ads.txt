2.  Introduction

   Multi-Agent Systems (MAS) represent a new paradigm in distributed
   computing where software components leverage Large Language Models
   (LLMs) to perform specialized tasks and solve complex problems
   through collaborative intelligence.  These systems combine LLMs with
   contextual knowledge and tool-calling capabilities, often abstracted
   through Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers, enabling dynamic
   workflows that adapt based on stored state and environmental
   conditions.

   The diversity and complexity of MAS architectures present unique
   challenges for discovery and composition.  As the ecosystem of AI
   agents expands, developers need efficient mechanisms to:

   *  *Discover compatible agents* with specific skills and capabilities

   *  *Evaluate performance characteristics* including cost, latency,
      and resource requirements

   *  *Compose multi-agent workflows* by linking agents with
      complementary capabilities

   *  *Verify claims* about agent performance and reliability

   *  *Track versioning and dependencies* between agent components

   The Agent Directory Service (ADS) [AGNTCY-ADS] addresses these
   challenges by providing a distributed directory infrastructure
   specifically designed for the agentic AI ecosystem.  Rather than
   attempting to formally define MAS architectures, which would
   constrain the creative composition patterns emerging in this rapidly
   evolving field—ADS focuses on providing flexible metadata storage and
   discovery mechanisms.  A comparison among registries which can be
   centralized or distributed is reported here [AI-Registry-Evolution].

2.1.  Core Capabilities

   ADS enables several key capabilities for the agentic AI ecosystem:

   *Capability-Based Discovery*: Agents publish structured metadata
   describing their functional abilities, costs, and performance
   characteristics.  The system organizes this information using
   hierarchical skill taxonomies, enabling efficient matching of
   capabilities to requirements.

   *Verifiable Claims*: While agent capabilities are often subjectively
   evaluated, ADS provides cryptographic mechanisms for data integrity
   and provenance tracking.  This allows users to make informed
   decisions about agent selection while enabling reputation systems to
   emerge organically.

   *Semantic Linkage*: Components can be securely linked to create
   various relationships like version histories for evolutionary
   development, collaborative partnerships where complementary skills
   solve complex problems, and dependency chains for composite agent
   workflows.

   *Distributed Architecture*: Built on proven distributed systems
   principles, ADS uses content-addressing for global uniqueness and
   implements distributed hash tables [DHT] for scalable content
   discovery across decentralized networks.

2.2.  Architectural Foundation

   The system leverages the Open Agentic Schema Framework (OASF) to
   model agent information in a structured, extensible format.  OASF
   enables rich queries such as "What agents can solve problem A?" or
   "What combination of skills and costs optimizes for task B?"  This
   schema-driven approach supports both objective metrics (token
   consumption, GPU requirements) and subjective evaluations (user
   ratings, task completion quality).

   Agent records are organized using modular extensions—reusable
   components like MCP server definitions, prompt-based agents, and
   evaluation metrics.  This modular approach facilitates composition
   and reuse across different MAS architectures while maintaining
   flexibility for innovative use cases.

   The underlying storage layer integrates with OCI (Open Container
   Initiative) [OCI.Image] standards, enabling interoperability with
   existing container ecosystems and leveraging mature tooling for
   content distribution and verification.

   This document details the technical architecture of ADS, covering the
   record storage layer, security model, distributed data discovery
   mechanisms, and data distribution protocols between storage nodes.

3.  Storage Architecture

   ADS implements a decentralized storage architecture built on OCI
   (Open Container Initiative) registries as the foundational object
   storage layer.  This design choice enables the system to leverage
   mature, standardized container registry infrastructure while
   achieving the speed, scalability, and security requirements of a
   distributed agent directory.

3.1.  Content-Addressed Storage

   The storage architecture centers on globally unique Content
   Identifiers (CID) that provide several critical properties for a
   distributed agent directory:

   *Immutability*: Content identifiers are cryptographically derived
   from the data they represent, ensuring that any modification results
   in a different identifier.  This property is essential for
   maintaining data integrity in agent records and enabling verifiable
   claims about agent capabilities.

   *Deduplication*: Identical content automatically receives the same
   identifier across all nodes in the network, eliminating storage
   redundancy and reducing bandwidth requirements when the same agent
   components are referenced by multiple systems.

   *Verifiability*: Any node can independently verify that received
   content matches its identifier, providing built-in protection against
   data corruption or tampering during transmission.

   *Location Independence*: Content can be retrieved from any node that
   possesses it, as the identifier serves as a universal pointer that
   abstracts away physical storage locations.

3.2.  OCI Integration

   ADS leverages OCI (Open Container Initiative) specifications for
   storing and distributing agent records as OCI artifacts, offering
   several advantages:

3.2.1.  Standards Compliance

   By building on OCI specifications, ADS inherits compatibility with
   the extensive ecosystem of container registry tools, security
   scanners, and management platforms.  This includes:

   *  *Authentication and authorization* mechanisms already deployed in
      enterprise environments

   *  *Content signing and verification* through tools like Notary and
      cosign

   *  *Vulnerability scanning* capabilities that can be extended to
      agent security assessments

   *  *Content delivery networks* optimized for OCI artifact
      distribution

3.3.  Record Artifact Specification

   ADS stores agent records as Record Artifacts following the OCI Image
   Manifest Specification [OCI.Manifest] and adhering to the OCI
   artifacts guidance [OCI.Artifact].  A Record Artifact is an AGNTCY
   OASF Record packaged as an OCI artifact.

3.3.1.  Manifest Structure

   The manifest structure MUST include the following properties:

   *  mediaType string

      This REQUIRED property MUST be application/
      vnd.oci.image.manifest.v1+json.

   *  artifactType string

      This REQUIRED property MUST be application/
      vnd.agntcy.dir.record.v1+json.  Future versions of the Record
      Artifact Specification MAY define additional artifact types.

   *  config descriptor

      This REQUIRED property MUST reference an empty configuration with
      media type application/vnd.oci.empty.v1+json, indicating that no
      additional configuration data is needed for Record Artifacts.

   *  layers array of objects

      This REQUIRED property MUST contain one or more layer descriptors
      representing OASF Record components.

   *  subject descriptor

      This OPTIONAL property MAY reference another Record Artifact to
      create linkage between records for version histories.

3.3.2.  Layer Structure

   Each layer descriptor MUST include the following properties:

   *  mediaType string

      This REQUIRED property specifies the layer content type.
      Implementations MUST support the following media types:

      -  application/vnd.agntcy.oasf.types.{version}.Record+json: The
         first layer (index 0) MUST use this media type and contains
         base record data.  This layer MUST use the data field for
         inline storage (base64-encoded) since the content is small,
         frequently accessed, and unique to each record.  Object
         annotations, schema_version and created_at are stored as part
         of layer annotations.

      -  application/vnd.agntcy.oasf.types.{version}.Skill+json:
         Contains skill definition data.  Object annotations, id and
         name are stored as part of layer annotations.

      -  application/vnd.agntcy.oasf.types.{version}.Domain+json:
         Contains domain definition data.  Object annotations, id and
         name are stored as part of layer annotations.

      -  application/vnd.agntcy.oasf.types.{version}.Locator+json:
         Contains locator definition data referencing the location where
         the agent can be accessed or deployed.  Object annotations,
         type and url are stored as part of layer annotations and URL
         fields.

      -  application/vnd.agntcy.oasf.types.{version}.Module+json:
         Contains module definition data.  Object annotations, id and
         name are stored as part of layer annotations.

      Media types MUST map to application/
      vnd.{schema_uri}.{version}.{type}+{encoding} format, where -
      {schema_uri} corresponds to the OASF protobuf schema namespace -
      {version} corresponds to a specific OASF type version (e.g.,
      v1alpha2) - {type} is the OASF type name (e.g. Record) -
      {encoding} MUST be json

   *  urls array of strings

      This OPTIONAL property MAY contain URLs pointing to external
      resources, particularly useful for Locator layers to specify
      deployment targets.

   *  annotations string-string map

      This OPTIONAL property contains arbitrary attributes.
      Implementations SHOULD use the predefined annotation keys:

      -  agntcy.oasf.record/schema_version: Schema version (for Record
         layers)

      -  agntcy.oasf.record/created_at: Creation timestamp (for Record
         layers)

      -  agntcy.oasf.locator/type: Locator type (for Locator layers)

      -  agntcy.oasf.skill/{id,name}: Skill id/name (for Skill layers)

      -  agntcy.oasf.domain/{id,name}: Domain id/name (for Domain
         layers)

      -  agntcy.oasf.module/{id,name}: Module id/name (for Module
         layers)

       "size": 702
     }
   }

3.3.4.  Record Reconstruction

   Applications consuming Record Artifacts MUST implement the following
   reconstruction algorithm:

   1.  *Pull Manifest*: Retrieve the OCI image manifest from the
       registry using standard OCI Distribution API operations

   2.  *Extract Base Record*: Parse the first layer (index 0) with media
       type application/vnd.agntcy.oasf.types.{version}.Record+json and
       base64-decode the data field to obtain the base record JSON data

   3.  *Retrieve Component Layers*: For each subsequent layer (Skill,
       Domain, Locator, Module):

       *  Fetch the blob content from the registry using the layer's
          digest

       *  Verify the blob's SHA-256 digest matches the descriptor's
          digest field

       *  Parse the JSON content according to the layer's mediaType

       *  Merge the component data into the appropriate field of the
          base record

       *  Merge descriptor annotations into the corresponding component
          metadata

   4.  *Validate Schema*: Validate the reconstructed record against the
       OASF schema version specified in the agntcy.oasf.record/
       schema_version annotation

3.4.  Application Integration

3.4.1.  Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF)

   The Open Agent Schema Framework (OASF) [AGNTCY-OASF] complements
   Record Artifact Specification by defining the actual data models for
   agent-related information referenced in the OCI artifacts.

3.4.2.  Third-Party Applications

   Third-party applications can build on top of the Record Artifact
   Specification to create tools and services for managing,
   distributing, and utilizing agent records.  This can be accomplished
   by leveraging existing OCI ecosystem components such as registries,
   clients, and tooling, or by developing custom solutions that link to
   Record Artifacts.

3.4.3.  Runtime Environments

   Runtime environments that deploy and manage agents can leverage
   Record Artifacts to obtain the necessary information for launching
   and managing agent instances based on the definitions contained
   within the artifacts.  Implementations can provide management of
   process lifecycles, monitoring, and other features based on the
   metadata defined in the records, or by linking records with runtime-
   specific artifacts.

3.5.  Artifact Organization

   Agent records are stored as OCI artifacts with a structured
   organization.  Records MUST be addressed by digest for immutable
   retrieval.  Tags are mutable aliases and can be used as human-
   readable pointers, but implementations MUST NOT assume a tag resolves
   to more than one manifest at a time.  The examples below show digest-
   pinned references:

   null_repo/records/

       ├── security-analyst:v3.0.0@sha256:yza567...
       └── research-assistant:v2.2.0@sha256:bcd890...

   This naming scheme demonstrates that the same content identifier can
   belong to multiple skills, reflecting the reality that many AI agents
   are multi-capable.  For example, the BERT-based agent
   (sha256:abc123...) appears under multiple skill categories:
   natural_language_processing/sentiment-analysis,
   natural_language_processing/text-classification, and
   natural_language_processing/emotion-detection, representing different
   capabilities of the same underlying agent implementation.  Similarly,
   the YOLO vision model (sha256:jkl012...) provides both object-
   detection and scene-understanding capabilities under
   images_computer_vision.

   This cross-referencing approach allows agents to be discovered
   through any of their supported capabilities while maintaining unique
   addressability through content identifiers.  Each skill category can
   have its own versioning and metadata, enabling fine-grained
   capability management even when multiple skills share the same
   underlying implementation.

   Each artifact contains structured metadata following OASF schemas,
   enabling rich queries and capability matching across all variants
   within a given category.

3.5.1.  Multi-Registry Federation

   The architecture supports federation across multiple registry
   instances, enabling:

   *  *Organizational boundaries*: Different organizations can maintain
      their own registries while participating in the global directory

   *  *Geographic distribution*: Content can be replicated to registries
      closer to consumers, reducing latency

   *  *Specialization*: Registries can focus on specific domains (e.g.,
      medical AI agents, financial analysis tools)

   *  *Redundancy*: Critical agent records can be replicated across
      multiple registries for availability

4.  MAS Data Discovery

   ADS implements a two-level mapping system that enables efficient
   discovery of Multi-Agent System components through a distributed hash
   table [DHT] architecture.  This approach separates capability-based
   discovery from content location, providing both scalability and
   flexibility in agent retrieval.

4.1.  Skill Taxonomy

   Effective agent discovery in multi-agent systems requires
   sophisticated organization of capabilities and skills.  ADS employs a
   hierarchical skill taxonomy that serves as the foundation for
   efficient search and discovery operations across the distributed
   network.

4.1.1.  The Challenge of Capability Search

   Traditional keyword-based search approaches face significant
   limitations when applied to agent discovery:

   *Vocabulary Fragmentation*: Different publishers may describe similar
   capabilities using varying terminology.  For example, "sentiment
   analysis," "opinion mining," and "emotional classification" may all
   refer to similar agent capabilities, leading to search results that
   miss relevant agents due to terminology mismatches.

   *Scale Complexity*: As the number of agents in the ecosystem grows,
   exhaustive search across all records becomes computationally
   prohibitive.  Without structured organization, every query
   potentially requires examining every agent record, leading to poor
   performance characteristics.

   *Semantic Relationships*: Many agent capabilities have natural
   hierarchical relationships that flat keyword systems cannot capture.
   An agent capable of "named entity recognition" is inherently relevant
   to searches for broader "text analysis" capabilities, but keyword
   matching alone cannot establish these connections.

4.1.2.  Taxonomy-Driven Search Optimization

   ADS addresses these challenges through a structured hierarchical
   taxonomy that provides several critical optimization benefits:

   *Search Space Partitioning*: The taxonomy enables efficient
   partitioning of the search space.  When processing a query for
   "computer vision" capabilities, the system can immediately focus on
   the relevant taxonomy branch, eliminating the need to examine agents
   in unrelated categories like natural language processing or
   mathematical reasoning.

   *Index Structure Optimization*: The hierarchical organization allows
   the distributed hash table to create specialized indices for
   different taxonomy branches.  Rather than maintaining a single
   massive index, the DHT can distribute indexing responsibility across
   nodes, with each node specializing in specific capability domains.

   *Query Semantic Expansion*: The taxonomy enables intelligent query
   expansion where searches automatically include semantically related
   subcategories.  A search for "text analysis" can transparently
   include results from "sentiment analysis," "entity extraction," and
   "text classification" without requiring users to explicitly enumerate
   all relevant subcategories.

   *Standardized Vocabulary*: By providing a canonical taxonomy, ADS
   reduces terminology fragmentation.  Publishers are encouraged to tag
   their agents using standardized skill categories, improving search
   precision and recall across the ecosystem.

4.2.  Two-Level Mapping Architecture

   The discovery system operates through two distinct mapping layers:

4.3.  Skill Taxonomy for Search Optimization

   ADS employs a hierarchical skill taxonomy to optimize search
   performance and enable efficient capability-based discovery.
   Taxonomies provide several critical advantages for agent discovery
   systems:

   *Search Space Reduction*: Rather than performing exhaustive searches
   across all agent records, taxonomies allow the system to quickly
   narrow the search space to relevant categories.  When a user queries
   for "natural language processing" capabilities, the system can
   immediately identify the subset of agents tagged with NLP skills
   without examining agents focused on computer vision or mathematical
   reasoning.

   *Hierarchical Organization*: Skills are organized in a tree-like
   structure *that reflects natural relationships between capabilities.
   For example:

   Natural Language Processing
   ├── Text Analysis
   │   ├── Sentiment Analysis
   │   ├── Named Entity Recognition
   │   └── Text Classification
   ├── Language Generation
   │   ├── Text Summarization
   │   ├── Content Creation
   │   └── Translation
   └── Conversational AI
       ├── Dialogue Management
       ├── Intent Recognition
       └── Response Generation

   This hierarchy enables both specific queries ("sentiment analysis
   agents") and broader capability searches ("all natural language
   processing agents") while maintaining efficient indexing structures.

   *Query Expansion and Refinement*: Taxonomies support automatic query
   expansion *where searches for parent categories can include relevant
   child categories.  A *query for "text analysis" can automatically
   include agents tagged with *"sentiment analysis," "named entity
   recognition," and "text classification" *without requiring users to
   know all specific subcategories.

   *Semantic Consistency*: Standardized taxonomies reduce ambiguity and
   improve *search precision by providing consistent terminology across
   the ecosystem.  This *prevents fragmentation where similar
   capabilities are described using different *terms by different
   publishers.

   *Scalable Indexing*: The hierarchical structure enables efficient
   distributed *indexing where different DHT nodes can specialize in
   specific taxonomy *branches, distributing both storage load and query
   processing across the *network.

4.4.  Additional Taxonomies

   While skills form the primary taxonomy for capability-based
   discovery, ADS supports multiple parallel taxonomies to enable rich,
   multi-dimensional agent classification and search.

4.4.1.  Domain Taxonomy

   The domain taxonomy organizes agents by their application domains,
   representing the broader problem spaces or industries where agents
   are designed to operate:

   Application Domains
   ├── Networking
   │   ├── Network Configuration
   │   ├── Traffic Analysis
   │   └── Protocol Implementation
   ├── Security
   │   ├── Threat Detection
   │   ├── Vulnerability Assessment
   │   └── Access Control
   ├── Software Development
   │   ├── Code Generation
   │   ├── Testing Automation
   │   └── Documentation
   ├── Finance and Business
   │   ├── Risk Analysis
   │   ├── Market Research
   │   └── Process Automation
   └── Healthcare
       ├── Medical Imaging
       ├── Clinical Decision Support
       └── Drug Discovery

   Domain classification enables users to discover agents that are
   specifically tuned for their operational context, even if those
   agents share similar underlying skills with agents from other
   domains.

4.4.2.  Feature Taxonomy

   The feature taxonomy categorizes agents by the integration frameworks
   and architectural patterns they support, facilitating the discovery
   of agents compatible with specific system architectures:

   Integration Features
   ├── MCP (Model Context Protocol)
   │   ├── MCP Server Implementation
   │   ├── MCP Client Integration
   │   └── MCP Tool Providers
   ├── A2A (Agent-to-Agent Communication)
   │   ├── Direct Messaging
   │   ├── Event-Driven Architecture
   │   └── Workflow Orchestration
   ├── Agent Evaluation
   │   ├── Performance Benchmarking
   │   ├── Quality Assessment
   │   └── Comparative Analysis
   └── Observability
       ├── Metrics Collection
       ├── Distributed Tracing
       └── Health Monitoring

4.4.3.  Multi-Dimensional Search

   The parallel taxonomy system enables sophisticated multi-dimensional
   queries that combine criteria across different classification axes.
   *All searches must include at least one skill criterion as the
   mandatory foundation*, with domain and feature taxonomies providing
   additional filtering dimensions:

   *  *Skill + Domain*: "Find natural language processing agents
      specialized for healthcare applications"

   *  *Skill + Feature*: "Discover computer vision agents that support
      MCP integration"

   *  *Skill + Feature + Domain*: "Locate natural language processing
      agents with observability features for manufacturing applications"

   *Skills as Search Foundation*: The skills taxonomy serves as the
   primary index structure in the DHT, making skill-based criteria
   mandatory for efficient query resolution.  This design ensures that:

   *  *Query Performance*: All searches leverage the optimized skills-
      to-CID mapping as the starting point, providing consistent
      performance characteristics

   *  *Result Relevance*: Domain and feature filters are applied to
      skill-based result sets, ensuring functional capability remains
      the core selection criterion

   *  *Index Efficiency*: The DHT can optimize storage and lookup
      patterns around the skills taxonomy while supporting supplementary
      filtering through domains and features

   Domain-only or feature-only queries are not supported, as they would
   bypass the primary indexing structure and provide results that may
   not have the functional capabilities required by the requesting
   system.

   This multi-taxonomic approach provides the flexibility to support
   diverse use cases while maintaining efficient indexing and search
   performance across all dimensions.

4.4.4.  Skills-to-CID Mapping

   The first level maps agent capabilities and skills to their
   corresponding Content Identifiers (CID):

Skills Index:
"natural_language_processing" → ["sha256:abc123...", "sha256:def456...", "sha256:ghi789..."]
"images_computer_vision"      → ["sha256:jkl012...", "sha256:mno345..."]
"analytical_skills"           → ["sha256:pqr678...", "sha256:abc123..."]
"multi_modal"                 → ["sha256:stu901...", "sha256:vwx234..."]

   This mapping enables queries such as "find all agents capable of
   natural language processing" to quickly resolve to a set of content
   identifiers without needing to search through individual agent
   records.

4.4.5.  CID-to-PeerID Mapping

   The second level maps Content Identifiers to the Peer IDs of nodes
   that store the corresponding agent records:

Content Location Index:
"sha256:abc123..." → ["12D3KooWBhvxmvKvTYGJvXjnGBp7Ybr9WyoXkZvFnRtC4aBcDeFg",
                      "12D3KooWXyZrUvHzPqKvTYGJvXjnGBp7Ybr9WyoXkZvFnRtC5gHi"]
"sha256:jkl012..." → ["12D3KooWZaBcDeFgXyZrUvHzPqKvTYGJvXjnGBp7Ybr9WyoXkZvF",
                      "12D3KooWGHiJkLmNoPqRsTuVwXyZ123456789AbCdEfGhIjKlMnO"]

   This separation allows the system to: - *Optimize for capability
   queries* without requiring knowledge of data locations

   *  *Enable dynamic content replication* as peer availability changes

   *  *Support multiple storage strategies* for the same content across
      different peers

4.5.  DHT-Based Discovery Process

   The Distributed Hash Table stores and maintains both mapping layers
   across the network:

   ADS uses [Kad-DHT] [DHT] for server and content discovery by using
   the libp2p implementation that constitutes the IPFS core DHT
   [libp2p-kad-dht].

                                +----------------+
                                |    DHT Node    |
                                | Content Index  |
                                +----------------+
                                       ^
                                       |
                      +----------------+-----------------+
                      |                |                |
              +-------v------+  +------v-------+  +-----v--------+
              | Server Node A |  | Server Node B|  | Server Node C|
              |   Content X  |  |   Content Y  |  |   Content Z  |
              +-------+------+  +------+-------+  +------+-------+
                      |               |                  |
                      |        Content Exchange          |
                      +---------------+------------------+
                                     |
                             Content Replication

   Flow:
   1. Servers register content with DHT
   2. DHT maintains content-to-server mappings
   3. Servers query DHT to locate content
   4. DHT returns list of servers hosting content
   5. Servers download content from peers

4.5.1.  Skill Registration

   When agents are published to the network:

   1.  *Capability Extraction*: The system parses OASF records to
       extract skills, domains, and capabilities

   2.  *DHT Updates*: Skills-to-CID mappings are distributed across DHT
       nodes using consistent hashing

   3.  *Location Registration*: Peer nodes register themselves as
       providers for specific CIDs

4.5.2.  Discovery Query Resolution

   Agent discovery follows a three-phase process:

   1.  *Capability Resolution*: Query "agents with skill X" resolves to
       a list of relevant CIDs via DHT lookup

   2.  *Location Resolution*: For each discovered CID, query DHT to find
       peer nodes storing the content

   3.  *Result Aggregation*: Combine capability matches with location
       information to produce actionable discovery results

Discovery Flow:
Query: "natural_language_processing" AND "finance_and_banking"
   ↓
Phase 1: Skills → CIDs
   DHT["natural_language_processing"] → ["sha256:abc123...", "sha256:def456..."]
   DHT["finance_and_banking"] → ["sha256:abc123...", "sha256:yza567..."]
   Intersection → ["sha256:abc123..."]
   ↓
Phase 2: CIDs → Peer IDs
   DHT["sha256:abc123..."] → ["12D3KooW...", "12D3KooX..."]
   ↓
Result: Agent sha256:abc123... available from peers 12D3KooW... and 12D3KooX...

4.5.3.  Additional Tanomoxies

4.6.  Content Distribution via OCI Protocol

   Once discovery identifies the relevant CIDs and their hosting peers,
   the actual agent records are retrieved using the OCI distribution
   protocol:

4.6.1.  Peer-to-Peer Synchronization

   The discovered list of CIDs enables efficient content synchronization
   [OCI.Distribution] between peers:

   1.  *Content Negotiation*: Requesting peer queries hosting peers for
       available agent records

   2.  *OCI Pull Operations*: Standard OCI registry pull commands
       retrieve agent artifacts and metadata

   3.  *Incremental Sync*: Only missing or updated content is
       transferred, reducing bandwidth requirements

   4.  *Verification*: Content integrity is verified through
       cryptographic hash validation during transfer

4.6.2.  Distribution Strategies

   The system supports multiple distribution patterns, each with
   distinct trade-offs and operational considerations:

   *On-Demand Retrieval*: Records are pulled from remote peers only when
   specifically requested, minimizing local storage requirements.

   _Trade-offs_: While this approach minimizes storage costs and ensures
   fresh content, it introduces several challenges:

   *  *Query Latency*: Each request requires network round-trips to
      locate and retrieve content, increasing response times

   *  *Network Cost*: Spurious or exploratory requests generate
      unnecessary network traffic and computational overhead

   *  *DoS Vulnerability*: The system becomes susceptible to denial-of-
      service attacks where malicious actors can trigger expensive
      content retrieval operations by flooding the network with requests
      for non-existent or rarely-accessed agents

   *  *Scalability Limits*: Performance degrades as the network grows
      due to increased query coordination overhead

   *Proactive Caching*: Popular or frequently accessed agents are
   automatically replicated to improve query response times.

   _Trade-offs_: This strategy offers significant scalability benefits
   but requires sophisticated management:

   *  *Performance Gains*: Dramatic reduction in query latency for
      popular content, enabling sub-second response times

   *  *Scalability*: Can handle high query volumes efficiently once
      popular content is cached locally

   *  *Popularity Measurement*: Requires implementing metrics collection
      and analysis to identify which agents warrant caching.  This
      includes tracking query frequencies, download patterns, and usage
      statistics across the network

   *  *Storage Requirements*: Needs sufficient local storage capacity to
      maintain cached copies of popular records

   *  *Cache Management*: Must implement cache eviction policies,
      freshness validation, and synchronization mechanisms

   *  *Administrator Oversight*: Proactive caching policies must be
      configured and monitored by agent directory node administrators to
      balance storage costs with performance benefits

   *Strategic Replication*: Critical agents can be replicated across
   multiple peers to ensure high availability and reduce single points
   of failure.

   _Trade-offs_: This approach addresses availability concerns but
   introduces subjective complexity:

   *  *High Availability*: Ensures critical agents remain accessible
      even during peer failures or network partitions

   *  *Reduced Single Points of Failure*: Distributes risk across
      multiple storage locations

   *  *Subjective Criticality*: The definition of "critical" or "useful"
      agents varies significantly between users, organizations, and use
      cases.  What constitutes strategic value for financial services
      may be irrelevant for manufacturing applications

   *  *Administrative Burden*: Requires agent directory node
      administrators to make strategic decisions about which agents
      warrant replication, considering factors like:

      -  Organizational priorities and business requirements

      -  Compliance and regulatory considerations

      -  Cost-benefit analysis of storage versus availability

      -  Community consensus on agent importance

   *  *Resource Allocation*: Strategic replication consumes storage
      resources that could otherwise be used for proactive caching of
      popular content

   *Administrative Management*: Both Proactive Caching and Strategic
   Replication require active management by agent directory node
   administrators.  Administrators must:

   *  Configure caching policies based on local network characteristics
      and storage capacity

   *  Monitor popularity metrics and adjust caching strategies
      accordingly

   *  Define strategic replication criteria aligned with organizational
      objectives

   *  Balance resource allocation between different distribution
      strategies

   *  Implement governance policies for content lifecycle management

   This architecture provides a scalable foundation for MAS data
   discovery that can efficiently handle large networks of distributed
   agents while maintaining low latency for capability-based queries.

}

   These examples demonstrate how the DHT indexing system extracts
   skills and domains from agent records to populate the Skills-to-CID
   mappings, enabling efficient capability-based discovery across the
   distributed network.

4.8.  Security Model

   The OCI-based architecture provides multiple layers of security that
   address the unique challenges of distributed agent directories:

4.8.1.  Cryptographic Integrity

   ADS leverages the OCI layer's built-in cryptographic mechanisms to
   ensure data integrity:

   *Automatic Hash Computation*: The OCI registry layer automatically
   computes SHA-256 hash digests for all stored artifacts.  These
   content identifiers are generated transparently during the push
   operation, ensuring that every agent record has a cryptographically
   verifiable fingerprint without additional overhead.

   *Tamper Detection*: Content addressing ensures immediate tamper
   detection through cryptographic hash verification.  Any modification
   to an agent record—whether malicious or accidental—results in a
   different hash digest, making unauthorized changes immediately
   detectable during retrieval operations.

   *End-to-End Verification*: Clients can independently verify that
   received content matches its advertised identifier, providing built-
   in protection against data corruption during transmission or storage
   without trusting intermediate network components.

4.8.2.  Content Provenance and Digital Signatures

   ADS integrates with Sigstore, a security framework for OCI storage,
   to provide comprehensive content provenance and authenticity
   guarantees:

   *Sigstore Integration*: The system leverages Sigstore's security
   framework to provide verifiable proof of when and by whom agent
   records were signed.  This creates an immutable audit trail that
   cannot be retroactively modified, enabling forensic analysis of agent
   deployment history.

   *Keyless Signing*: Sigstore's keyless signing approach eliminates the
   complexity and security risks associated with long-lived
   cryptographic keys:

   *  *Identity-Based Authentication*: Uses OpenID Connect (OIDC)
      [OpenID.Auth] tokens from trusted identity providers (GitHub,
      Google, Microsoft) to authenticate publishers at signing time

   *  *Short-Lived Certificates*: Issues ephemeral signing certificates
      valid only for minutes, reducing the window of potential key
      compromise

   *  *Automatic Key Rotation*: Eliminates the need for manual key
      management, distribution, and rotation procedures

   *  *Scalable Trust*: Publishers don't need to maintain or distribute
      public keys, making the system accessible to individual developers
      and large organizations alike

   *Transparency and Verification*: All signatures are stored directly
   in OCI storage alongside the agent artifacts and public keys,
   providing:

   *  *Public Auditability*: Anyone can verify the signing history of
      agent records stored in accessible registries

   *  *Non-Repudiation*: Publishers cannot deny having signed records
      that are cryptographically linked to their identity

   *  *Supply Chain Security*: Enables detection of compromised or
      unauthorized agent publications

4.8.3.  Trust Boundaries and Isolation

   *Organizational Isolation*: Separate registries maintain security
   boundaries between different organizations, allowing each entity to
   control their own agent ecosystem while still participating in the
   broader federated network.

   *Content Verification*: Nodes can validate artifact integrity and
   signature authenticity without trusting transport layers or
   intermediate storage systems.  This zero-trust approach ensures
   security even when using untrusted storage infrastructure.

   *Reputation Systems*: The cryptographic foundation enables the
   development of reputation systems based on verifiable evidence rather
   than subjective claims.  Publishers with consistent signing practices
   and high-quality agents can build measurable trust over time.

4.8.4.  Threat Mitigation

   The security model addresses several key threats to distributed agent
   directories:

   *Supply Chain Attacks*: Sigstore integration and transparency logs
   make it difficult for attackers to inject malicious agents without
   detection, as all publications are cryptographically signed and
   publicly auditable.

   *Data Integrity Attacks*: Automatic hash verification prevents
   tampering with agent records during storage or transmission, ensuring
   users receive authentic content.

   *Identity Spoofing*: OIDC-based keyless signing prevents attackers
   from impersonating legitimate publishers without compromising their
   identity provider credentials.

   *Availability Attacks*: The distributed nature of the system,
   combined with content replication across multiple registries,
   provides resilience against denial-of-service attacks targeting
   individual nodes.

4.8.5.  Access Control

   *  *Registry-level permissions* control who can publish and retrieve
      agent records

   *  *Fine-grained policies* can restrict access to specific agent
      categories or capability types

   *  *Audit trails* leverage existing registry logging capabilities to
      track access patterns

4.8.6.  Trust Boundaries

   *  *Organizational isolation* through separate registries maintains
      security boundaries

   *  *Content verification* allows nodes to validate artifact integrity
      without trusting transport layers

   *  *Reputation systems* can build on cryptographic proofs of past
      agent performance

4.9.  Performance Optimizations

   The architecture incorporates several optimizations for the specific
   requirements of agent discovery:

4.9.1.  Bandwidth Optimization

   *  *Incremental updates* use OCI layer semantics to transmit only
      changed portions of agent records

   *  *Content compression* reduces storage and transmission costs for
      large agent definitions

   *  *Selective replication* based on query patterns minimizes
      unnecessary data transfer

4.9.2.  Scalability Architecture

   The system scales horizontally through several mechanisms:

   *  *Registry sharding* distributes storage load across multiple OCI
      registry instances

   *  *Index partitioning* in the DHT allows query load to scale with
      the number of participating nodes

   *  *Lazy loading* defers retrieval of detailed agent specifications
      until actually needed

   This architecture provides a robust foundation for a decentralized
   agent directory that can scale to support the growing ecosystem of AI
   agents while maintaining the security and reliability requirements of
   production systems.
